# Interview-Algorithms

A repository with my solutions to different algorithm problems found around the internet. The idea is to sharp my skills for potential interviews in the future

# Repository Structure

Each folder deals with a specific problem. It will contain the source of the problem (when aplicable), a description of the problem and one or more solutions with their respective analysis of space and time complexity.

## Problem list

So far, these are the problems covered. In parenthesis is the time complexity for the most efficient solution found.

#### _[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://github.com/LeandroTeixeira/Interview-Algorithms/tree/main/Best%20Time%20to%20Buy%20and%20Sell%20Stock)_ ( O(n) ).

#### _[Maximum Subarray](https://github.com/LeandroTeixeira/Interview-Algorithms/tree/main/Maximum%20Subarray)_ ( - ).
